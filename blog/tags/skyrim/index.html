I vividly remember battling for the rebellion. I remember fighting the evil Empire with rebels at my side. I remember slaying dragons with my sword and shield. What I don&#x27;t remember is all the Nordic racism.</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="first-some-context"></a>First some context<a class="hash-link" href="#first-some-context" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> is a first-person fantasy roleplaying game from <em>Bethesda Softworks</em> initially released in 2011. Being the fifth game in the series, there&#x27;s certainly an abundance of history and context to the game and the series as a whole. I have not played any previous games in the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> series, but I plan on playing the third (Morrowind) and fourth (Oblivion) games soon. The game is set in a Viking like land called Skyrim, where local Nords rebel against the Empire and its imperial citizens, but soon the player discovers dragons attacking, and they must save the world.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="the-game-mechanics"></a>The Game Mechanics<a class="hash-link" href="#the-game-mechanics" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The game consists of speaking to NPCs, delving into dungeons while fighting baddies, looking said dungeons, and repeating. This gameplay loop is incredibly fun, if a little plain. Nearly every dungeon has a linear path, and very few quests have choices within. <strong>The player is not asked to roleplay and solve the world&#x27;s problems but is instead to do given tasks in order on a checklist.</strong> The player is presented with checklists of tasks to complete, which all fall into four broad categories: 1) fight something, 2) take something, or 3) talk to someone. Fighting and taking more often than not are done in one of the game&#x27;s hundreds of dungeons and talking takes place in one of the few dozen town-like locations.</p><p>This is important, since it means the agency of the player is not in how they interact with the world, but with which quests they choose to accept or reject. Very few quests are mutually exclusive. You can join, work for, and even be in charge of many of the different factions simultaneously. After training to become the Arch-Mage in the magic College of Winterhold, I proceeded to rebuild the Dark Brotherhood of assassins and then do odd jobs for the Thievesâ€™ Guild. The only decisions that locked me out of doing other quests were the civil war quest line, and the Dawnguard DLC. Because the civil war is such a defining part of the setting, and it&#x27;s one of the rare times the player is forced to choose between factions, the sheer force at which the game pushes you to join the Stormcloak rebellion shocked me.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="the-first-quest"></a>The First Quest<a class="hash-link" href="#the-first-quest" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Let&#x27;s consider the first quest of the game: <em>Unbound</em>. The player is presented with a list of objectives that increase as objectives are completed:</p><ul><li>Make your way to the keep</li><li>Enter the Keep with Hadvar or Ralof</li><li>Escape Helgen</li><li>Find some equipment (Hadvar)</li><li>Loot Gunjar&#x27;s body (Ralof)</li><li>Search the barrel for potions (optional)</li><li>Attempt to pick the lock of the cage (optional)</li></ul><p>Note that this quest does contain some choices. The most impactful is whether to follow Hadvar or Ralof. When escaping a dragon attack, the player is &quot;presented&quot; the choice to follow either of these men, but ultimately, they both take nearly the same path.</p><p>You start bound and nearly executed by the Empire for unnamed crimes alongside Stormcloak soldiers and Ulfric himself. When a dragon attacks, Ralof (a Stormcload rebel) helps you escape. Then after a rooftop jump, Hadvar (the man who moments earlier were about to execute you), helps lead you to safety. These two parties meet up, and after a few lines of dialogue you can follow whichever, you want.</p><p>The issue here should be obvious. The decision isn&#x27;t an interesting choice, because the player naturally sides with the rebels. The imperials explicitly and actively wanted the player dead. There&#x27;s no good reason for the player to side with the imperials. This is exacerbated by the path leading to the imperials being significantly further away than the Stormcloak&#x27;s path.</p><p>The last exchange between the two soldiers is this: </p><blockquote><p>Ralof: &quot;We&#x27;re escaping, Hadvar. You&#x27;re not stopping us this time.&quot;<br>
Hadvar: &quot;Fine. I hope that dragon takes you all to Sovngarde.&quot;  </p></blockquote><p>Hadvar tells us it&#x27;s fine we&#x27;re escaping, but that he hopes the dragon kills us. The game paints from the beginning the Empire as an evil force to escape and overcome, and the Stormcloaks as a fun, underdog rebellion to fight for. My issue is that the Empire is not a monolithic evil government, and Ulfric is a charismatic but terrible politician.</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="ulfric-is-a-bad-ruler-for-in-game-reasons"></a>Ulfric is a bad ruler for in game reasons<a class="hash-link" href="#ulfric-is-a-bad-ruler-for-in-game-reasons" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="stormcloaks-vs-the-empire"></a>Stormcloaks vs The Empire<a class="hash-link" href="#stormcloaks-vs-the-empire" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>200 years have passed since the events of Oblivion, and Bethesda&#x27;s writers added some substantial historical events. The sudo-roman Empire (Imperials) went to war with the Third Aldmeri Dominion. The war started with a list of demands including the outlaw of the worship of the Nord god Talos and ended with a peace treaty agreeing to nearly all those demands. Because of this, years later Ulfric Stormcloak kills the high king of Skyrim, and thus a civil war begins.</p><p>The writers clearly love Ulfric. He&#x27;s a charismatic leader who was trained by the greybeard monks to magically shout his opponents to death. He fought in the great war to protect his people and his religion, only for his religion to be outlawed at the end of it anyways. Ulfric gives heroic speeches and takes action to achieve his goals. In the beginning, you&#x27;re in the same <del>boat</del> <em>cart</em> as him and about to be executed together.</p><p>Sadly, Ulfric cares for Nords and Nords alone. One of Skyrim&#x27;s many half-baked ideas is the migrant dark elves in the slums of Windhelm. Characters talk about the poverty they face, and how they&#x27;re ignored by the town guards, but there are no meaningful ways to interact with this. Ulfric apparently sends battalions to save lone Nords, but ignores Khajit caravansâ€™ pleas for help, and his own townsfolk in Windhelm. Ulfric outlawed Argonians from purchasing property in town. If you ask Ulfric about these issues, he blames his guards&#x27; incompetency and the civil war (which he started) for distracting him.</p><p>Talos isn&#x27;t really outlawed, but the game pretends he is. Talos is one of the divine gods in Skyrim, and the only formerly mortal divine. The Thalmor&#x27;s distain for Talos seems more because of Elven-supremacy propaganda than real issues. In fact, the Empire doesn&#x27;t even enforce the ban. Shrines lay in public areas of Markarth and Winterhold. I expected that after convincing Winterhold to side with the Empire, the ever-annoying Talos priest in the main square would disappear or be arrested, but even after the war nothing changes. The Empire never enforces the Talos ban.</p><p>Skyrim wants us to root for this guy and ignore his tangible and racist policies.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="ulfrics-provinces-are-problematic-at-best"></a>Ulfric&#x27;s provinces are problematic at best<a class="hash-link" href="#ulfrics-provinces-are-problematic-at-best" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Let&#x27;s consider each of the four towns under Ulfric&#x27;s control at the start of the game: Windhelm, Winterhold, Riften, and Dawnstar.</p><p>As we saw above, his hometown of Windhelm has deliberate and systematic oppression of minorities. Ulfric refuses to care while the war is going on and doesn&#x27;t seem to view his &quot;Skyrim for the Nords&quot; rhetoric as the cause for many of these issues.</p><p>Winterhold houses Skyrim&#x27;s one and only mage college. Most of the town collapsed 80 years ago. The mages believe the cause to be the eruption of a volcano in Morrowind 117 year prior to the collapse (shady evidence at best), but the townsfolk blame the machinations of the college. The town itself seemingly has no regulations guiding the college, as even Necromancy and wild experimentation is allowed. The Jarl grants you titles after helping drunks pay their bar tabs, or inn patrons steal things. Overall, Winterhold is fun to visit if you avoid the town and are simply there for the college.</p><p>Riften is another town governed by one guild, except instead of the College of Winterhold, Riften has the Thievesâ€™ Guild. Most politicians and nobles are corrupted and bribed. Everyone in town knows and can&#x27;t stop talking about the Thievesâ€™ Guild in the sewers, but no guards ever investigate. The docs have thieves. The tavern has thieves. The market has thieves. Honestly, despite being more prominent, the government is more useless than Winterhold&#x27;s Jarl.</p><p>Dawnstar is an old mining town rules by a paranoid and mad Jarl convinced that sending off every able body to war is the only solution. The two mines directly oppose each other and share no resources. A cultist builds a museum to his demon worshiping family. To top it all off, the town is currently cursed such that nightmares plague all it&#x27;s residents so frequently nobody gets any sleep.</p><p>None of the other towns compare to how incompetently ruled Ulfric Stormcloak&#x27;s lands are.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="why-did-he-kill-the-king-anyway"></a>Why did he kill the king anyway?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-did-he-kill-the-king-anyway" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Ulfric killed the high king without justified reasons. The game alludes to years of tensions between him and the former king, but little is said of what these problems were. Ulfric challenged the high king to a fight to the death and won. There&#x27;s little in specifics that I can find, but this is what I can gather from the game and the wiki:</p><ul><li>Nords value strength, so their kings may be challenged to prove the weakness of their opponent</li><li>If the high king is bested in a challenge, the winner is sometimes granted the throne after a king&#x27;s moot</li><li>If the high king dies, a moot is called to decide which of his heirs will be the next king.</li></ul><p>Either way, the Jarls of all the holds of Skyrim must gather to decide the next king. If a moot was held during the events of Skyrim, it seems obvious that Ulfric would win without a civil war.</p><ul><li>Windhelm, Winterhold, Dawnstar, and Riften all support Ulfric enough to go to war.</li><li>Solitude would likely be against him since the new Jarl after the king&#x27;s death is his widowed wife.</li><li>Markarth was saved personally from invasion by Ulfric not 30 years ago.</li><li>Whiterun is deliberately left undecided in the civil war, but as stated above their most prominent shrine is to Talos (thus a vote in favor of Ulfric).</li><li>That just leaves the minor holds of Falkreath and Morthal, who in the game side with the Empire initially.</li></ul><p>Without any political maneuvers, Ulfric would already win the nomination with 5 nearly guaranteed votes. For a charismatic and experienced leader like Ulfric, this should be easy, however Ulfric refuses to have a moot. Why he refuses is unclear, but what is clear is blame for the war falls squarely on his shoulders.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="ulfric-is-inadvertently-helping-his-fantasy-nazi-enemies"></a>Ulfric is inadvertently helping his fantasy-Nazi enemies<a class="hash-link" href="#ulfric-is-inadvertently-helping-his-fantasy-nazi-enemies" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Skyrim has an organization of High Elves named the Thalmor which are pretty explicitly references to the Nazis of the second world war. The Third Aldmeri Dominion is ruled by a shadowy nationalist political party known as the Thalmor. They can be seen kidnapping and persecuting Nords in Skyrim far from their homeland. They start wars of aggression against nearby states. Even their nation&#x27;s name &quot;The Third Aldmeri Dominion&quot; is a reference to the Third Reich.</p><p>Despite the references to real world fears, these are fantasy-Nazis. They do not commit true systemic horrors like their real-world equivalents but are simply a fun group of evil bad guys to rescue prisoners from and fight against.</p><p>The Thalmor are explicitly the only reason Talos is &quot;outlawed&quot; in Skyrim. The Empire signed the white-gold treaty to stop <em>The Great War</em>, but in large part due to fear of an eventual Thalmor victory. We learn from General Tullius that the general plan of the emperor is to regroup, regain the Empire&#x27;s strength, and prepare for an eventual continued war with the Thalmor. By starting a civil war, Ulfric weakens himself, his people, and potentially fractures the Empire leaving room for the Thalmor to dominate. In fact, in the game the Thalmor have a dossier on Ulfric describing how a long and indecisive civil war in Skyrim directly aids the Thalmor.</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h1><p>Like the last name implies, Ulfric Stormcloak is very much a cloak that aids the fantasy-Nazis&#x27; goals. He&#x27;s a charismatic war vet fighting to &quot;take back&quot; Skyrim and keep &quot;Skyrim for the Nords&quot;. He ignores the troubles of minorities and fails to govern his provinces. The Thalmor manipulate him, the Empire is weakened by him, and nobody wins except him and his Nord friends.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/skyrim">skyrim</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/video-games">video games</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about [Draft] Ulfric is a bad, despite Skyrim convincing you otherwise" href="/blog/ulfric-is-a-bad-boy"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Pages</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/welcome">Welcome</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Community</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/aldman123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aldman123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Reddit</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:alexander@aldridge.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">alexander@aldridge.ca</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 Alexander Aldridge.
